*So...*

Down to week 8 from Launch Academy, and all i can say at this point is that is
has been brutal, not only due to the fact we're learning tons of material in 11 weeks,
but also because my health has been here and there. I have been battlling with
headaches my whole life. At first it was migrane headaches, I couldn't deal with
lights, sounds, or just moving would feel like the whole world was falling apart
(literally). About 4 or 5 years ago i was to say i was cured from it, *just like that*.
Thank God!
But then for some time it continued but it was a different type of pain, as if it
was sinus headache. But not too long ago I have settled it's some sort of food/allergy/*hashtag*mybodysucks tension headaches. Unfortunately there are times nothing I do seems to help it. I try massaging, I try over the counter meds, some sort of icy/hot cream, herbs, teas, the works and nothing. Why am i telling you all this?
I don't know, so you feel sympathy? not so. So it may encourage you to pursue what you like, what you have passion for. Even though your body is complaning, or your brain seems to be slow, or perhaps its a mindset thing. I have found *something* good here. And if I am coming through, I know you can do it as well.
