#My Impressions Of VIM 

Most people starting their journey as a software developer will start off with these 
text editors such as Atom, Sublime Text, Notepad, Textmate and others.

I started using VIM just recently, and I didn't start using it earlier because of fear, fear it would be too hard.
Truth is I didn't want to shift my attention or effort to learn how to use a new text editor since I was comfortable with my choice at the time.

I guess I was encouraged to get out of my comfortable zone and start learning now because I had seen people coding in it.

Now it amazes me to see someone who really knows how to use the text editor VIM and be
as productive as one can be. 

Then I was told about [this](http://www.cranberrycoder.com/blog/2015/01/25/the-stages-of-vim ) blog post from one of my Instructors/Mentors at Launch Academy.

I started following it, but soon got caught up doing other things and ended up putting it aside for a few days or weeks. 
Still VIM was constantly in the back of my mind. Could I become more productive using it? Is the learning curve as steep as they say it is?

Yes and yes.

VIM users will condemn those that use the arrow keys, or the mouse.
One thing that I heard from other VIM users that had the same feelings I did when they were beginnig this life 
long leaning experience was that, "it is okay for you to not disable your arrow keys, and use your mouse as much as
you need". "Eventually one will question whether there's a better way of accomplishing that task/command". 
And there my friend is where one learns best. 
I find myself having that urge to just use the mouse and calling it a day. But I know there has to be a better way of accomplishing whatever I am trying at the time. 
It is deliberating to not depend on the mouse or have to move your hands away from the home keys, so much. 

I also take the advantage of using Vimium, a plug in for Chrome that uses the same key strokes as VIM. 

Right now I don't think I am on the high productivity level yet. But one thing I am certain, I enjoy coding even better today. 
I'm solidifying what I picked up already and learning new things here and there as code.

Right now I'm using [Pivotal Labs](https://github.com/pivotalcommon/vim-config) vim config. I have again and again come back to the description (README) part for reference. 

My take on this is if you're unhappy with your ol'text editor and/or is intrigged by how powerful VIM can be in your hands. 
I say give it a try, expect to get frustrated and want to go back to your trusted text editor.
But if you have the patience and determination to power through the roller coaster of emotions, you'll find that VIM isn't that scary at all. 
Use your arrow keys, use your mouse, but if you feel like there are better ways of accomplishing what you're doing now then adopt it. 

In any way happy coding...
