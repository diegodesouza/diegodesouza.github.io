Welcome to my first real blog.

As i get in the habit of writing, I will try to post something interesting
(atleast to me) once a month to start. Hopefully, along the way I will
development *better* writing skills as well as *better* critical thinking skills, that will
reciprocate in *better* communication skills. I hope to learn tons with this,
and plan on doing some tutorials in the future. So keep tuned and lets do this.
