# JavaScript funnn!

...Just a little distraction from studying

...open up your JavaScript console from your favorite browser Chrome *of course*..
...(In case you have forgotton this is the command `option + command + j` for the
  console)..

...You should be able to the console by now, and anything after the `>` will be
  executed by the browser interpreter..

...enter this

  ```javascript
  Array(16).join("let's have some fun" -1) + " Batman!"
  ```

...get it?
